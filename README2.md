# exclovise • Portfolio

Hey there! This is my personal developer portfolio — a place where I share the things I’m building, learning, and messing with. It’s powered by GitHub Pages and lives at:

🔗 **[exclovise.github.io/portfolio](https://exclovise.github.io/portfolio/)**  
🎯 Soon to be hosted on **[exclovise.com](https://exclovise.com)**

## 🧠 About This Site

I built this to show off some of my favorite projects — mostly things related to:

- 🧱 Minecraft / Eaglercraft tools and server utilities
- 🌐 Web-based tools and experiments

- 💡 Random ideas I wanted to try out

I’ll be updating it over time as I work on more stuff.
